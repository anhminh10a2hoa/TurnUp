# Project Name: Turn Up

An app to help you find something to do in the city of Tampere e.g., when you are travelling for a business and have an evening to spend, or you are looking for something new or different to do

## Branch name convention:

A git branch should start with a category. Pick one of these: feature, bugfix, hotfix, test and docs.

+ feature is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
+ bugfix is for fixing a bug
+ hotfix is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
+ test is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket
+ docs is for writing, updating or fixing documentation

Including Jira (or other Project Management Tool) ticket numbers

<b>For example</b>: if we have ticket number 1 with the title "Create an API for selecting and storing user personal interests" so the branch should be: <code>feature/Create-an-API-for-selecting-and-storing-user-personal-interests</code>
